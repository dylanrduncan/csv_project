# matplotlib_csv
Advanced Python - Matplotlib - using CSV files

this project is to teach students how to use CSV files in python
this project also teaches students how to visualize the data using matplotlib

this project includes 5 python scripts:

sitka1.py simply creates a chart of the sitka airport weather station's reported highs in the month of july 2018

Sitka2.py does the same as sitka 2, but this time includes dates in the x-axis of the chart.

Sitka3.py compares Sitka airport weather station's highs and lows for all of 2018, while also including a shading between the highs and lows.

Death_valley.py compares the death_valley highs and lows with shading between them, similar to Sitka3.

Finally, the sitka_v_death_valley.py program is the most complex of the 5:
it takes 2 files and will compare them by creating 2 subplots for each weather station, includes colored highs, lows, and shading between them;
the plot also includes a title for both subplots, making it easy to understand what data you are looking at. This makes it easy to compare two 
groups of weather data.
